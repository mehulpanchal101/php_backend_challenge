I have attached POSTMAN Collection for API call file name BackendChellange.postman_collection

I have created two new endpoints for migration and seeder for the table using core php. laravel provides such nice mechanisam for the migration and seeder.

run complete `docker-compose up`

then call http://localhost:8321/setup, for the automated seeding I have placed events.json file into migration folder. for easy seeding through API Call (Development Purpose only), whilte running this endpoint database table created and also event data also get filled.

# for connecting to the database

connect your docker container for sql-db-<\_> and run below command
docker exec -it <container_id> sh
mysql -u codingchallenge -p (and enter the password)
SHOW databases; (will list all databases)
USE codingchallenge;
Select \* from events;

for Rollback call http://localhost:8321/setup-rollback, Also added rollback endpoints for clear database and seeder.

Also created configuration file, migration file that will setup the project as well.

I have created models folder where I have kept event Class for the events table for sql oprations
